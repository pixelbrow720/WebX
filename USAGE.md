## Reconnaissance

The reconnaissance module helps gather information about your target, including subdomains, infrastructure details, and technology identification.

### Steps:
1. Enter the target domain name (e.g., example.com)
2. Select scan type:
   - **Basic**: Quick scan for essential information
   - **Comprehensive**: In-depth scan for detailed reconnaissance
3. Additional options:
   - **DNS Enumeration**: Discover DNS records and potential subdomains
   - **Technology Detection**: Identify web technologies, frameworks, and servers
   - **Port Scanning**: Discover open ports and services (use responsibly)
4. Click the "Start Reconnaissance" button
5. View results in the dashboard once the scan completes

## Attack Surface Mapping

This module identifies potential entry points and vulnerability areas in the target application.

### Steps:
1. Enter the complete target URL (e.g., https://example.com)
2. Define crawling depth (1-5):
   - Lower depths (1-2) are faster but less comprehensive
   - Higher depths (3-5) provide more thorough mapping but take longer
3. Additional options:
   - **Include Parameters**: Map URL parameters for potential injection points
   - **Form Analysis**: Analyze forms for potential input validation issues
   - **API Endpoint Detection**: Attempt to identify API endpoints
4. Click the "Map Attack Surface" button
5. Review the generated attack surface map showing potential entry points

## Vulnerability Scanning

Automated scanning to identify common security weaknesses and misconfigurations.

### Steps:
1. Enter the target URL
2. Select scan type:
   - **Quick Scan**: Tests for common high-risk vulnerabilities
   - **Standard Scan**: Balanced approach testing most OWASP Top 10 issues
   - **Comprehensive Scan**: In-depth testing for a wide range of vulnerabilities
3. Enable additional options as needed:
   - **Authentication**: Provide credentials for authenticated scanning
   - **Custom Headers**: Add custom headers for the scan requests
   - **Exclude Paths**: Specify paths to exclude from scanning
4. Click the "Start Vulnerability Scan" button
5. Monitor scan progress and review findings when complete

## Manual Testing

Tools for manual testing against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and other security issues.

### Steps:
1. Enter the target URL
2. Select the type of vulnerability to test:
   - **SQL Injection**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - **XML External Entity (XXE)**
   - **Command Injection**
   - **Other vulnerabilities...**
3. Enter custom payloads if needed
4. Configure request parameters:
   - **HTTP Method**: GET, POST, PUT, etc.
   - **Headers**: Custom headers for the request
   - **Cookies**: Session cookies if needed
5. Click the "Start Manual Test" button
6. Analyze the response to determine if the vulnerability exists

## Advanced Exploitation

Combine multiple vulnerabilities to demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and their impact.

### Steps:
1. Enter the target URL
2. Select the exploitation chain to run:
   - **Authentication Bypass → Privilege Escalation**
   - **XSS → Session Hijacking**
   - **SQL Injection → Data Exfiltration**
   - **Other exploitation chains...**
3. Add custom payloads if needed
4. Configure chain parameters:
   - **Execution Delay**: Time between steps
   - **Persistence**: Whether to maintain access
   - **Evidence Collection**: What evidence to gather
5. Click the "Execute Exploitation Chain" button
6. Review the exploitation results and impact assessment

## Reporting

Generate comprehensive reports with findings, evidence, and remediation recommendations.

### Steps:
1. Enter the target name and report title
2. Select report format:
   - **PDF**: Formal report suitable for presentations
   - **HTML**: Interactive report with clickable elements
   - **JSON**: Machine-readable format for integration
3. Choose to include AI analysis if needed:
   - **Risk Assessment**: AI-powered risk scoring
   - **Remediation Prioritization**: Suggested fix order
   - **Code Snippets**: Example fixes for vulnerabilities
4. Click the "Generate Report" button
5. View available reports in the reports section
6. Download or share reports as needed

## Best Practices

1. **Always obtain permission** before testing any system
2. Start with less intrusive tests before moving to more aggressive ones
3. Document all findings and actions taken
4. Follow responsible disclosure procedures if vulnerabilities are found
5. Use the tool's AI analysis to help prioritize remediation efforts
